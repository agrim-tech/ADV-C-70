                <p>Avengers: Age of Ultron is the next big team up of the beloved characters against Ultron. While Ultron seems like a pretty good villain, some setup leading to the birth of Ultron outside this movie could've helped a lot. It seems like a villain has been created in the movie and has been destroyed in the same movie and doesn't seem to have a greater impact with his presence(Although there are consequences in Civil War, but Ultron isn't there anymore). Some of the elements of this movie feel like right out of a horror movie and some feel a little dull. But as a whole this is another good entertaining Marvel movie.</p>

                <p>As a long time cars fan watching this movie mad me sick. This story and movie as a whole would have been extremely better if Cruz Ramirez wasn’t apart of it. She not only ruined the story with a cliche passing of the torch but has given little hope for new cars movies to come. While they were setting up to see lightning over come his weakness like he had done before they completely disbanded it by having an annoying irrelevant unrealistic car pass him during his the final lap at doc’s old track. Just seeing Lightnig train by himself would have been enough, even to have just one sentimental moment between Lightning and Smokey without hearing how hard Cruz had it when she was a kid. I don’t care about Cruz, her story or anything that has to do with her. Maybe I’m just a stubborn fan who likes to see the main character actually be the main character and not have a terrible excuse of a new one trying to take his place.</p>

        <h4>The impact of climate change is not the same everywhere ⁠— some parts have something to gain but that’s not a good thing overall</h4>

        <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 list-group-item-text">Global warming may affect the entire world, but some countries have more to lose than others, particularly India. On the flip side, some countries stand to gain from the melting ice caps and rising sea levels — at least on an economic level — like Alaska, North Canada and Siberia.
A working paper by researchers at the Princeton University pegs the possible welfare loss by up to 15% by the end of the century for some of the hottest regions of the world. Meanwhile, the coldest regions could be possible beneficiaries.
The impact of climate change is different not only between countries but there are large deviations within a country. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in a report released in April 2020, said that agricultural states, like Punjab and Bihar, will be more affected by global warming than others.</p>

        <h4>The environmental impacts of cars, explained</h4>
        <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="imgfornews2.jpg">
        <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 list-group-item-text">Cars consume a lot of energy before they ever make it to the open road. Automotive production leaves a giant footprint because materials like steel, rubber, glass, plastics, paints, and many more must be created before a new ride is ready to roll.

Similarly, the end of a car’s life doesn’t mark the end of its environmental impact. Plastics, toxic battery acids, and other products may stay in the environment. Fortunately, junkyard pile-ups are becoming much smaller than they were in the past. About three-quarters of today’s average car, including the bulk of a steel frame, can be recycled.</p>
